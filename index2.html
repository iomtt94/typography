                        <p>I got a raise at 3 PM, at 4 I was laid off. Exactly two months before our twins were due and
                            my wife and I would become parents for the first time. It was just another Thursday
                            afternoon, at 3 PM I spoke to my manager who told me that I got a small raise. At 4 we were
                            both jobless. This paints a perfect picture of how the layoffs were organised in complete
                            secrecy despite “transparency” being one of the main company values. My laptop was remotely
                            shut down just minutes after I learned the news<em> </em>and that was it. After five years,
                            I was no longer a senior product designer at the company where I had helped build the design
                            department. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>

                                <p>I felt lost. It’s like standing completely naked outside in the middle of a blizzard
                                    — alone, sad, shocked, empty. But mostly scared. Scared because we had two babies on
                                    the way and my job was our only regular financial income. My wife cried when I told
                                    her: “How can they do this to someone expecting children?” I was silent. Shame and
                                    guilt started to settle in and wreak havoc in my head. I turned into a shell of a
                                    person.</p>

                        <p>I went to the local supermarket the day after and met an old classmate from the university. I
                            hadn’t seen him for more than 10 years and was surprised that he lived in the same
                            area.<br>“You live around here now?”<br>“Yeah, we just bought a flat not far from
                            here”<br>“Oh really? We bought a house in this town last year…”</p>
                        <p>I put on a smile and kept up with the small talk, but all I could think was “Don’t ask me
                            what I do, please don’t ask me about my job…” We spent chatting for five minutes and I
                            dreaded each pause in our chat, fearing that <em>that</em> question might come up.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>It didn’t. I was safe. Being jobless was shameful enough, I didn’t want to tell anyone about
                            it. But later I was ashamed of being ashamed. Your mind starts to play tricks on you when
                            something so traumatic happens.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I can’t tell you the details of my layoff, so I decided to be the voice of the many designers
                            who had to go through this traumatic event. I ran a survey and received 159 answers, which
                            is amazing, considering how hard it was to find these laid-off designers. I even got to
                            speak to more than 30 of them and listened to their stories. Here they are, along with the
                            stats from my research. I changed the names of the designers behind these stories to protect
                            their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Most of the designers who answered my survey were UX/Product designers (76%), 5% of them were
                            design managers, and 9% were design generalists (<strong>Fig 1</strong>).</p>

                        <p>Martin, a designer from The Netherlands got laid off in the same month as I, five months
                            later the company re-opened his position and started hiring again. “They didn’t contact me
                            if I wanted it back, so I think my elimination was targeted. The most disappointing thing
                            was to see how my former colleagues completely forgot how badly the company treated me and
                            gladly reshared the ‘we’re hiring’ post on LinkedIn.”</p>
                        <p>Matthias, a designer from Germany had proof that his elimination was targeted: “I was told
                            that my role was eliminated but it was clear from the pull request to the code of a page on
                            the company’s website (which is public), that another designer was put in my position. I had
                            conflicts with the department leadership so I’m convinced that I was targeted and retaliated
                            against. I filed a formal complaint but nothing happened.” Matthias was a contractor so
                            there were no laws protecting him. Similarly to me, his laptop was shut down minutes after
                            the news and he was discarded and forgotten about. He was two months from his fifth
                            anniversary at the company.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Martin and Matthias are just two of the many designers who think that their eliminations were
                            targeted and a form of retaliation. In fact, my research suggests (<strong>Fig 3</strong>)
                            that 22% of laid-off designers think that they were eliminated based on retaliation. 42% of
                            them said they were publicly vocal about the problems in their companies and that’s what got
                            them in trouble.&nbsp;</p>

                            boot. She was disappointed by the lack of responsibility from the CEO: “The stock of the
                            company where I worked dropped from around $130 per share to less than $30 in just five
                            months. Yet, it’s the CEO of this company who gets to decide to ax 7% of its employees. Why
                            doesn’t he carry some responsibility for the terrible results of the company? Why is he

                                <p>Based on my research, most designers who got axed were high performers — 52% of them
                                    to be exact (<strong>Fig 4</strong>). Only 2% of them scored “low” on their most
                                    recent performance evaluation. The worrying stat from this question is that 34% of
                                    respondents said they didn’t do performance evaluations. This means that there were
                                    a lot more high performers than 52%, they just weren’t formally evaluated.

                            for layoffs</h2>
                        <p>Lucie, a Senior Product Designer from France, told me her story of how her problems with
                            burnout put her on the layoff list: “I was completely abandoned by my manager and the UX
                            department leadership when I burned out after four years with the company. I received no
                            support and was put under additional pressure to perform better. And that’s at a company
                            where the CEO publicly said “As a company, we should take a lot of care that there’s no
                            pressure to work long hours.” Managers were supposed to keep an eye out for people who risk
                            burning out. Instead, when I burned out, I was blamed and told that I needed to improve. I
                            had to take a full month of sick leave to recover (which wasn’t enough) and was unfairly
                            given a low performance evaluation score at the end of the year because of it. Right then I
                            knew that if layoffs were to happen, I’d be on the list.”</p>
                        <p>Lucie isn’t an outlier. There are many designers that I spoke with who mentioned similar
                            problems. Constantly being put under pressure, burning out, and conflicts with managers and
                            the leadership. In fact, 19% of respondents said they had conflicts with their direct
                            manager, 41% said they questioned the competence of their managers (some publicly), and 24%
                            of them said they had conflicts with the company leadership (<strong>Fig 5</strong>). These
                            stats paint a sad reality of how designers are treated in tech companies.&nbsp;</p>

                            they said they overhired in the previous year, combined with those who were with the company
                            for less than a year we get to almost 46%. But wait a minute. This isn’t the majority. The
                            majority — 54% of them have been with the company for two years or more. These weren’t the

                        <p>Why are there so many designers that were there for two, three, four, five years and more?
                            Why is there another spike at five years? If their reason for laying people off was true,
                            most designers would be in less than a year and one-year answers. I believe this proves that
                            some of these eliminations truly were targeted.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Layoffs are a great opportunity for companies to toss out the “unwanted” employees. Have
                            trouble burning out? Getting in conflicts with the leadership? Too vocal? Leaving for
                            parental leave on top of that? Off you go! They can replace them with new, fresh, and more
                            eager designers who’ll gladly do more for less. That’s what happened where I worked — the
                            designers that were laid off were all senior. Soon after the layoffs (we’re talking days)
                            several intermediate designers were promoted to senior positions. They probably tried to
                            improve the morale among those that remained but here’s what they missed: A newly-promoted
                            senior designer isn’t equal to a senior designer who has been a senior for years. A change
                            of title doesn’t make them more experienced overnight.&nbsp;</p>
                        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large m-t-1">

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>And why is there another spike at five years? I spoke to David, a designer who told me his
                            story and could be an explanation for this. In the weeks before getting laid off, the
                            company leadership shared the engagement survey results with all the employees. One of the
                            key findings was that people who had been with the company for longer (five years or more,
                            which included him) were generally less “engaged.” Putting it bluntly, they were unhappier.
                            I wouldn’t be surprised if a similar pattern emerged elsewhere and that’s why a lot of
                            senior people were let go.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I’m confident when I say that most of these layoffs can be attributed to copycat behaviour.
                            After the layoffs at the company where I worked were announced publicly, someone wrote the
                            following on a social media platform:</p>
                        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                            <p>It’s quite simple: If you don’t follow the herd, you risk being blamed if you fail. But
                                if you follow the herd and do what everyone else is doing, even if the herd runs off of
                                a cliff, nobody points any fingers.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Beautifully put. Now, let’s leave all this behind us and move on to what you can do to
                            prepare for the layoffs.</p>
                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you can and should do to prepare for layoffs</h2>
                        <p>Here’s a fact: you will be laid off. It’s only a matter of when not if. Maybe not from your
                            current job, but someday in the future it’ll be you who’ll receive an unexpected email, or
                            get ambushed into a meeting with the manager of your manager and a legal advisor. What are
                            you doing to prepare for that? What can you do? Here are a couple of things.</p>
                        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Launch a side gig</h3>
                        <p>Gladly, I had been running two projects on the side — <a
                                href="http://betterwebtype.com">Better Web Type</a> and <a href="https://uxbuddy.co">UX
                                Buddy</a>. They represented around 30% of my income at the time of layoff and it’s
                            something I have been working on ever since. With two babies and being a first-time parent,
                            I decided I wanted to spend as much time with them as I could and not get a new job, despite
                            being offered many lucrative positions.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Working on my projects allows me to work a lot less and one day it’ll be these projects that
                            will provide for the financial wellbeing of my family. If you don’t have a side project that
                            you’re monetising and something that you could scale in case of getting laid off, you’re
                            risking a lot.</p>
                        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Keep track of your work</h3>
                        <p>I run <a href="https://uxbuddy.co">UX Buddy</a>, a course and a mentoring program to help
                            designers get better jobs. One of the top three problems designers have is not keeping track
                            of their work so when they have to create their portfolios, they don’t know where to start.
                            If you get laid off, you’ll only have access to your laptop for a few more minutes. You’ll
                            lose all the work you ever did for your company. Don’t risk that.</p>
                        <p>Start a document to keep track of the projects you worked on and add the following details
                            for each one:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Short description of the problem and how you uncovered it</li>
                            <li>What did you do?</li>
                            <li>Challenges &amp; how you overcame them. How long it took to complete?</li>
                            <li>What were the results? What about the next steps?</li>
                            <li>Links to the design artefacts that you created (wireframes, screenshots of whiteboards
                                in Mural or Miro, sketches, designs in Figma)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I have a template for that which I only share with the students of my course but I’ll share
                            it with you for free here. <a
                                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RqDbAn3ypnIlx2LdiyMQzbuYBNbcI-dLbs4nyE0Lzyo/copy?usp=sharing">Check
                                it out</a>. Then create a reminder on your calendar to remind you every month to update
                            the doc.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Make local copies of your designs</h3>
                        <p>This one should be obvious but it often isn’t until it’s too late. Regularly make copies of
                            all your design files, especially those in Figma. If you get laid off, you’ll never be able
                            to access them again. Create a reminder on your calendar to remind you every month and stick
                            to it.</p>
                        <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Start networking now</h3>
                        <p>And not when it’s too late. This recommendation comes from <a
                                href="https://www.betterbydesign.cc/p/a-tale-of-three-layoffs">Patrick Morgan who was
                                laid off three times in his career so far</a>. This is also the one that I always sucked
                            at. I just didn’t get how to network or why. It became clear when the layoffs hit. If you
                            start networking now, you’ll be much more likely to bounce back quickly. It doesn’t need to
                            be fancy either, just connect with people on LinkedIn. By “connect” I mean engage with their
                            posts, comment on them, and send them DMs. Don’t just add them as your connections.</p>
                        <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting laid off is a great opportunity</h2>
                        <p>Remembering that traumatic Thursday afternoon, my wife and I still discuss the layoff
                            sometimes. She recently said to me: “You know why they picked you right? They probably had
                            99 reasons but the main one is that we were expecting children. They knew that you needed
                            all the cash you could get so you’d be more than happy to sign the termination agreement,
                            collect the severance, and remain silent. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the laid-off
                            recently had babies or were about to. They’re the most vulnerable people.”</p>
                        <p>Tech companies are great at selling all the benefits, including paid parental leave when they
                            try to lure you in to come work for them. But they’re also quick to forget that you’re a
                            human being once they decide you’re “unwanted.” Patrick Morgan put it best:</p>
                        <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
                            <p>Tech companies talk a good game about their devotion to their people but at the end of
                                the day, they’re profit-seeking enterprises that exist to return value to their
                                shareholders. If cutting headcount will help a company achieve that objective, it won’t
                                hesitate. </p>

                        <p>The days after my layoff are still a blur. I remember taking the dog for her morning walk,
                            which I had been doing for months because my wife was feeling too sick to keep at it. But it
                            was different now. I always felt in a hurry on these morning walks, pulling the dog by the
                            leash in all directions as I walked nervously. I just wanted to get it done because I was in
                            a rush to start working.</p>
                        <p>All of a sudden I could stop. Sit down, enjoy the view, the winter sun, and the brisk air. It
                            was amazing to watch the weak morning sun rays slowly dissolve the mist in the valley below.
                            I heard the birds singing in a nearby forest. It seemed like I heard them for the very first
                            time. Finally, I wasn’t in a hurry anymore. I could process the anger, the shame, and the
                            guilt that had been haunting me ever since the layoff. It didn’t take me long to realise
                            that I was presented with an amazing opportunity, perhaps the opportunity of my lifetime —
                            everything was finally and completely in my own hands. I felt liberated. This quote from
